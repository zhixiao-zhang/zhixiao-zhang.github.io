  summary: 'The Spectre speculative side-channel attacks pose formidable threats for
    security. Research has shown that code following the cryptographic constant-time
    discipline can be efficiently protected against Spectre v1 using a selective variant
    of Speculative Load Hardening (SLH). SLH was, however, not strong enough for protecting
    non-cryptographic code, leading to the introduction of Ultimate SLH, which provides
    protection for arbitrary programs, but has too large overhead for general use,
    since it conservatively assumes that all data is secret. In this paper we introduce
    a flexible SLH notion that achieves the best of both worlds by generalizing both
    Selective and Ultimate SLH. We give a suitable security definition for such transformations
    protecting arbitrary programs: any transformed program running with speculation
    should not leak more than what the source program leaks sequentially. We formally
    prove using the Rocq prover that two flexible SLH variants enforce this relative
    security guarantee. As easy corollaries we also obtain that, in our setting, Ultimate
    SLH enforces our relative security notion, and two selective SLH variants enforce
    speculative constant-time security.'
  tldr: '- Addresses the incomplete security of Speculative Load Hardening (SLH) against
    Spectre v1 attacks: Selective SLH only protects constant-time cryptographic code,
    while Ultimate SLH secures arbitrary programs but imposes prohibitive performance
    overhead by treating all data as secret.


    - Introduces a flexible SLH mechanism that generalizes both Selective and Ultimate
    SLH, allowing security policies to be tailored per program—applying strong hardening
    only where needed—and formally proves its security using the Rocq theorem prover.


    - Provides a practical, verifiable defense for non-cryptographic software, enabling
    efficient memory safety against speculative execution attacks without assuming
    all data is secret, thus bridging the gap between security and performance for
    low-level system code.'
  ai_score: 8
  ai_reason: The paper addresses speculative side-channel attacks (Spectre) via program
    transformations, directly intersecting with memory safety, program analysis, formal
    semantics, and sanitizer techniques, though it does not explicitly focus on Rust,
    type systems, or pointer analysis.
