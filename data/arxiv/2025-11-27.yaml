  title: 'SV-LIB 1.0: A Standard Exchange Format for Software-Verification Tasks'

  summary: In the past two decades, significant research and development effort went
    into the development of verification tools for individual languages, such asC,
    C++, and Java. Many of the used verification approaches are in fact language-agnostic
    and it would be beneficial for the technology transfer to allow for using the
    implementations also for other programming and modeling languages. To address
    the problem, we propose SV-LIB, an exchange format and intermediate language for
    software-verification tasks, including programs, specifications, and verification
    witnesses. SV-LIBis based on well-known concepts from imperative programming languages
    and uses SMT-LIB to represent expressions and sorts used in the program. This
    makes it easy to parse and to build into existing infrastructure, since many verification
    tools are based on SMT solvers already. Furthermore, SV-LIBdefines a witness format
    for both correct and incorrect SV-LIB programs, together with means for specifying
    witness-validation tasks. This makes it possible both to implement independent
    witness validators and to reuse some verifiers also as validators for witnesses.
    This paper presents version 1.0 of the SV-LIBformat, including its design goals,
    the syntax, and informal semantics. Formal semantics and further extensions to
    concurrency are planned for future versions.
  tldr: '- Addresses the fragmentation in verification tools by creating a common
    exchange format (SV-LIB) that allows tools designed for one language (e.g., C)
    to be reused for others, reducing redundant development.

    - Uses an imperative-style intermediate language with SMT-LIB expressions to represent
    programs, specifications, and verification witnesses, enabling interoperability
    with existing SMT-solver-based verification infrastructure.

    - Enhances memory and system security by enabling independent witness validation
    and broader tool reuse, ensuring verification results (proofs or counterexamples)
    are trustworthy and not tool-specific.'
  ai_score: 7
  ai_reason: The paper's focus on a verification exchange format directly supports
    program analysis and formal semantics tools that could implement memory safety,
    spatial safety, and pointer analysis techniques.
