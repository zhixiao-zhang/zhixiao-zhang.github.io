  title: Cost-Driven Synthesis of Sound Abstract Interpreters

  summary: Constructing abstract interpreters that provide global soundness guarantees
    remains a major obstacle in abstract interpretation. We investigate whether modern
    LLMs can reduce this burden by leveraging them to synthesize sound, non-trivial
    abstract interpreters across multiple abstract domains in the setting of neural
    network verification. We formulate synthesis as a constrained optimization problem
    and introduce a novel mathematically grounded cost function for measuring unsoundness
    under strict syntactic and semantic constraints. Based on this formulation, we
    develop a unified framework that unifies LLM-based generation with syntactic and
    semantic validation and a quantitative cost-guided feedback mechanism. Empirical
    results demonstrate that our framework not only matches the quality of handcrafted
    transformers, but more importantly, discovers sound, high-precision transformers
    for complex nonlinear operators that are absent from existing literature.
  tldr: '- Addresses the difficulty of manually constructing abstract interpreters
    that guarantee global soundness, a key requirement for reliable static analysis
    in security and verification.

    - Uses LLMs to synthesize abstract interpreters by formulating the task as a constrained
    optimization problem with a mathematically grounded cost function for unsoundness,
    combined with syntactic/semantic validation and cost-guided feedback.

    - Enables automatic generation of sound, high-precision analyzers for complex
    operations (e.g., nonlinear functions in neural networks), reducing manual effort
    and improving the trustworthiness of memory safety and system security analyses.'

  ai_reason: The paper directly addresses abstract interpretation, program analysis,
    and formal semantics while developing sound abstract interpreters with mathematical
    foundations relevant to type systems and safety properties.

  title: 'It''s a Feature, Not a Bug: Secure and Auditable State Rollback for Confidential
    Cloud Applications'

  summary: Replay and rollback attacks threaten cloud application integrity by reintroducing
    authentic yet stale data through an untrusted storage interface to compromise
    application decision-making. Prior security frameworks mitigate these attacks
    by enforcing forward-only state transitions (state continuity) with hardware-backed
    mechanisms, but they categorically treat all rollback as malicious and thus preclude
    legitimate rollbacks used for operational recovery from corruption or misconfiguration.
    We present Rebound, a general-purpose security framework that preserves rollback
    protection while enabling policy-authorized legitimate rollbacks of application
    binaries, configuration, and data. Key to Rebound is a reference monitor that
    mediates state transitions, enforces authorization policy, guarantees atomicity
    of state updates and rollbacks, and emits a tamper-evident log that provides transparency
    to applications and auditors. We formally prove Rebound's security properties
    and show through an application case study -- with software deployment workflows
    in GitLab CI -- that it enables robust control over binary, configuration, and
    raw data versioning with low end-to-end overhead.
  tldr: '- Addresses the risk of replay and rollback attacks on cloud applications
    through untrusted storage, which can reintroduce stale data to compromise decisions,
    while also allowing legitimate rollbacks for recovery from corruption or misconfiguration.

    - Uses a reference monitor to mediate state transitions, enforce authorization
    policies, ensure atomic updates and rollbacks, and produce a tamper-evident log
    for transparency and auditability.

    - Enhances memory safety and system security by enabling secure, auditable state
    management that prevents unauthorized rollback attacks without blocking necessary
    operational recoveries, reducing vulnerabilities in confidential cloud environments.'
  ai_score: 8
  ai_reason: The paper focuses on security frameworks for state transitions and rollback
    protection in cloud applications, directly addressing memory safety through secure
    storage interfaces and program analysis through formal verification of security
    properties.
