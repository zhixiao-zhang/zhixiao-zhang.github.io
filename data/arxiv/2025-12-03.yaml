  title: 'TypeDis: A Type System for Disentanglement'

  summary: "Disentanglement is a runtime property of parallel programs guaranteeing\
    \ that parallel tasks remain oblivious to each other's allocations. As demonstrated\
    \ in the MaPLe compiler and run-time system, disentanglement can be exploited\
    \ for fast automatic memory management, especially task-local garbage collection\
    \ with no synchronization between parallel tasks. However, as a low-level property,\
    \ disentanglement can be difficult to reason about for programmers. The only means\
    \ of statically verifying disentanglement so far has been DisLog, an Iris-fueled\
    \ variant of separation logic, mechanized in the Rocq proof assistant. DisLog\
    \ is a fully-featured program logic, allowing for proof of functional correctness\
    \ as well as verification of disentanglement. Yet its employment requires significant\
    \ expertise and per-program proof effort.\n  This paper explores the route of\
    \ automatic verification via a type system, ensuring that any well-typed program\
    \ is disentangled and lifting the burden of carrying out manual proofs from the\
    \ programmer. It contributes TypeDis, a type system inspired by region types,\
    \ where each type is annotated with a timestamp, identifying the task that allocated\
    \ it. TypeDis supports iso-recursive types as well as polymorphism over both types\
    \ and timestamps. Crucially, timestamps are allowed to change during type-checking,\
    \ at join points as well as via a form of subtyping, dubbed subtiming. The paper\
    \ illustrates TypeDis and its features on a range of examples. The soundness of\
    \ TypeDis and the examples are mechanized in the Rocq proof assistant, using an\
    \ improved version of DisLog, dubbed DisLog2."
  tldr: '- The paper addresses the difficulty of statically verifying *disentanglement*—a
    runtime property where parallel tasks operate on separate memory regions—without
    requiring complex, manual proofs in separation logic.


    - It introduces **TypeDis**, a type system using **timestamps** on types to identify
    the allocating task, with features like *subtiming* (a form of subtyping) and
    polymorphism to allow timestamp changes at control-flow join points.


    - This matters for memory safety and system security because it enables **automatic,
    task-local garbage collection without synchronization**, reducing runtime overhead
    and preventing data races in parallel programs through compile-time guarantees.'
  ai_score: 9
  ai_reason: The paper directly addresses memory safety and type systems by presenting
    a type system for statically verifying disentanglement, a property crucial for
    safe parallel memory management, which intersects with program analysis, formal
    semantics, and type theory.

  title: 'Belobog: Move Language Fuzzing Framework For Real-World Smart Contracts'

  summary: Move is a research-oriented programming language design for secure and
    verifiable smart contract development and has been widely used in managing billions
    of digital assets in blockchains, such as Sui and Aptos. Move features a strong
    static type system and explicit resource semantics to enforce safety properties
    such as the prevention of data races, invalid asset transfers, and entry vulnerabilities.
    However, smart contracts written in Move may still contain certain vulnerabilities
    that are beyond the reach of its type system. It is thus essential to validate
    Move smart contracts. Unfortunately, due to its strong type system, existing smart
    contract fuzzers are ineffective in producing syntactically or semantically valid
    transactions to test Move smart contracts. This paper introduces the first fuzzing
    framework, Belobog, for Move smart contracts. Belobog is type-aware and ensures
    that all generated and mutated transactions are well-typed. More specifically,
    for a target Move smart contract, Belobog first constructs a type graph based
    on Move's type system, and then generates or mutates a transaction based on the
    graph trace derived from the type graph. In order to overcome the complex checks
    in Move smart contracts, we further design and implement a concolic executor in
    Belobog. We evaluated Belobog on 109 real-world Move smart contract projects.
    The experimental results show that Belobog is able to detect 100\% critical and
    79\% major vulnerabilities manually audited by human experts. We further selected
    two recent notorious incidents in Move smart contracts, i.e., Cetus and Nemo.
    Belobog successfully reproduced full exploits for both of them, without any prior
    knowledge.
  tldr: '- Addresses the risk that Move smart contracts, despite strong static typing,
    still contain vulnerabilities (like logic errors or complex condition bugs) that
    evade the type system and can lead to financial losses in blockchains managing
    billions in assets.

    - Uses a type-aware fuzzer that builds a type graph from the contract’s code to
    generate and mutate only well-typed transactions, combined with concolic execution
    to handle complex runtime checks and explore deeper paths.

    - Matters because it provides the first effective automated testing for Move contracts,
    detecting real-world exploits (e.g., in Cetus and Nemo) and critical vulnerabilities
    that human audits find, directly enhancing memory and asset safety in low‑contract
    environments.'
  ai_score: 8
  ai_reason: The paper presents a type-aware fuzzing framework for the Move language,
    directly engaging with its strong static type system and program analysis to uncover
    vulnerabilities beyond type safety, aligning with the researcher's interests in
    type systems, program analysis, and formal semantics.
