  title: Path-optimal symbolic execution of heap-manipulating programs

  summary: Symbolic execution is at the core of many techniques for program analysis
    and test generation. Traditional symbolic execution of programs with numeric inputs
    enjoys the property of forking as many analysis traces as the number of analyzed
    program paths, a property that in this paper we refer to as path optimality. On
    the contrary, current approaches for symbolic execution of heap-manipulating programs
    fail to satisfy this property, thereby incurring crucial path explosion effects.
    This paper introduces POSE, path-optimal symbolic execution, a symbolic execution
    algorithm that originally achieves path optimality against heap-manipulating programs.
    We formalize the POSE algorithm and experiment it against a benchmark of programs
    that take data structures as inputs, supporting the potential of POSE for improving
    on the state of the art of symbolic execution of heap-manipulating programs.
  tldr: '- Addresses path explosion in symbolic execution for heap-manipulating programs,
    where current methods create redundant analysis traces due to aliasing, unlike
    numeric-input programs which fork only per program path.

    - Introduces POSE, a path-optimal symbolic execution algorithm that ensures each
    program path is analyzed exactly once by precisely tracking heap states and aliasing
    conditions.

    - Improves memory safety and low-level security analysis by enabling efficient,
    exhaustive exploration of heap-dependent program behaviors, crucial for finding
    bugs in systems code with data structures.'

  ai_reason: The paper's focus on symbolic execution for heap-manipulating programs
    directly addresses memory safety, spatial safety, and pointer analysis through
    program analysis techniques.
