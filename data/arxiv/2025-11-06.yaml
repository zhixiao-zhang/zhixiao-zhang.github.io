  summary: 'This paper introduces SecRepoBench, a benchmark to evaluate code agents
    on

    secure code completion in real-world repositories. SecRepoBench has 318 code

    completion tasks in 27 C/C++ repositories, covering 15 CWEs. We evaluate 28

    standalone LLMs and 13 code agents across 3 state-of-the-art agent frameworks

    using our benchmark. We find that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle with

    generating correct and secure code completions. However, code agents

    significantly outperform standalone LLMs. We show that SecRepoBench is more

    difficult than the prior state-of-the-art benchmark. Finally, our comprehensive

    analysis provides insights into potential directions for enhancing the ability

    of code agents to write correct and secure code in real-world repositories.'
  tldr: '- Addresses the lack of benchmarks for evaluating security-aware code completion
    in realistic C/C++ repository contexts, where current models miss real-world vulnerability
    patterns.

    - Creates SecRepoBench with 318 tasks across 27 C/C++ repositories covering 15
    Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) to test code agents and LLMs.

    - Shows code agents significantly outperform standalone LLMs, revealing current
    AI coding tools'' limitations in preventing memory safety vulnerabilities like
    buffer overflows or use-after-free errors.

    - Provides measurable evidence that real-world secure coding requires more than
    raw LLM capability, impacting software supply chain security and vulnerability
    reduction.'
  ai_score: 8
  ai_reason: The paper directly addresses memory safety and security through C/C++
    code completion tasks covering 15 CWEs, aligning with memory safety, spatial safety,
    and sanitizer focuses while using program analysis techniques.
