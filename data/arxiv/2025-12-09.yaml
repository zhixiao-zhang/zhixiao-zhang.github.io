  summary: Test input generators are an important part of property-based testing (PBT)
    frameworks, and a key expectation is that they be capable of producing all acceptable
    elements that satisfy both the function's input type and the generator-provided
    constraints. However, it is not readily apparent how to validate whether a particular
    generator's output satisfies this coverage requirement. In practice, developers
    typically rely on manual inspection and post-mortem analysis of test runs to determine
    whether a generator provides sufficient coverage; these approaches are error-prone
    and difficult to scale as generators grow more complex. To address this problem,
    we present a new refinement-type-based verification procedure for validating the
    coverage provided by input test generators, based on a novel interpretation of
    types that embeds "must-style" underapproximate reasoning principles as a fundamental
    part of the type system. In our formulation, the types associated with expressions
    capture the set of values guaranteed to be produced by the expression, rather
    than the usual interpretation in which types represent the set of values an expression
    may produce. We formalize the notion of coverage types in a rich core language
    supporting higher-order functions and inductive datatypes. To better support real-world
    test generators, we extend this type system with type and qualifier polymorphism,
    enabling static verification of coverage guarantees for test input generators
    constructed using the monadic combinators found in most PBT frameworks. Finally,
    we have implemented a coverage type checker for OCaml programs based on this core
    calculus and present a detailed evaluation of its utility using a corpus of benchmarks
    drawn from both the PBT literature and open-source projects.
  tldr: '- Addresses the problem of verifying whether property-based testing generators
    can produce all required inputs, as current manual or post-mortem checks are unreliable
    and don''t scale with generator complexity.


    - Introduces coverage types as refinement types that statically guarantee the
    set of values an expression must produce, using a polymorphic type system to support
    higher-order functions and monadic combinators common in testing frameworks.


    - Provides a formal, automated method to ensure test generators achieve full input
    coverage, which is critical for memory and system security because incomplete
    testing can miss vulnerabilities in low-level code.'
  ai_score: 8
  ai_reason: The paper introduces a refinement-type system for verifying test generator
    coverage, directly engaging with type theory, formal semantics, and program analysis
    to ensure underapproximate guarantees, which aligns with the researcher's focus
    on type systems, program analysis, and formal verification techniques.
