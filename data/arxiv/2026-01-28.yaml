  summary: "Compilers constitute the foundational root-of-trust in software supply\
    \ chains; however, their immense complexity inevitably conceals critical defects.\
    \ Recent research has attempted to leverage historical bugs to design new mutation\
    \ operators or fine-tune models to increase program diversity for compiler fuzzing.We\
    \ observe, however, that bugs manifest primarily based on the semantics of input\
    \ programs rather than their syntax. Unfortunately, current approaches, whether\
    \ relying on syntactic mutation or general Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuning,\
    \ struggle to preserve the specific semantics found in the logic of bug-triggering\
    \ programs. Consequently, these critical semantic triggers are often lost, resulting\
    \ in a limitation of the diversity of generated programs.\n  To explicitly reuse\
    \ such semantics, we propose FeatureFuzz, a compiler fuzzer that combines features\
    \ to generate programs. We define a feature as a decoupled primitive that encapsulates\
    \ a natural language description of a bug-prone invariant, such as an out-of-bounds\
    \ array access, alongside a concrete code witness of its realization. FeatureFuzz\
    \ operates via a three-stage workflow: it first extracts features from historical\
    \ bug reports, synthesizes coherent groups of features, and finally instantiates\
    \ these groups into valid programs for compiler fuzzing.\n  We evaluated FeatureFuzz\
    \ on GCC and LLVM. Over 24-hour campaigns, FeatureFuzz uncovered 167 unique crashes,\
    \ which is 2.78x more than the second-best fuzzer. Furthermore, through a 72-hour\
    \ fuzzing campaign, FeatureFuzz identified 113 bugs in GCC and LLVM, 97 of which\
    \ have already been confirmed by compiler developers, validating the approach's\
    \ ability to stress-test modern compilers effectively."
  tldr: '- The problem is that existing compiler fuzzing methods—relying on syntactic
    mutations or general LLM fine-tuning—often lose the specific semantic logic (like
    an out-of-bounds access) that historically triggered bugs, limiting the diversity
    and effectiveness of generated test programs.


    - The core method is FeatureFuzz, which extracts "features" from past bug reports:
    each feature pairs a natural-language description of a bug-prone invariant with
    a concrete code snippet. It then recomposes these semantic features into coherent
    groups and instantiates them into valid C programs to fuzz compilers.


    - This matters because compilers are a root-of-trust in software supply chains;
    defects can lead to security vulnerabilities or silent miscompilation. By preserving
    and recombining proven bug-triggering semantics, FeatureFuzz more effectively
    uncovers deep, critical compiler bugs—finding 113 bugs in GCC/LLVM in 72 hours,
    with 97 confirmed by developers.'
  ai_score: 8
  ai_reason: The paper's focus on compiler fuzzing via semantic logic recomposition
    directly engages program analysis, formal semantics, and type system invariants
    to uncover memory and spatial safety defects in critical software like GCC and
    LLVM.
