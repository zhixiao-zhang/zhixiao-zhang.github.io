  title: 'SEAL: Symbolic Execution with Separation Logic (Competition Contribution)'

  summary: SEAL is a static analyser for the verification of programs that manipulate
    unbounded linked data structures. It is based on separation logic to represent
    abstract memory states and, unlike other separation-logic-based approaches, it
    employs a general-purpose separation logic solver Astral for satisfiability and
    entailment checking, which itself is based on translation to SMT. This design
    results in a modular architecture intended to be easier to extend and to combine
    with reasoning in other theories. Although still a prototype, SEAL achieved competitive
    results in the LinkedLists base category and was one of only four analysers capable
    of verifying programs with unbounded lists. We believe that the tool's extensibility,
    combined with further development, can lead to significant improvements in future
    competitions.
  tldr: '- Addresses the challenge of automatically verifying memory safety and functional
    correctness in programs that use unbended linked data structures, a key source
    of bugs in low-level systems code.

    - Uses separation logic to model complex heap states and a general-purpose solver
    (Astral) that translates logical reasoning into SMT queries to check program properties.

    - Provides a modular, extensible foundation for proving absence of memory errors
    (like use-after-free) in heap-manipulating code, which is critical for securing
    systems software.'
  ai_score: 8
  ai_reason: The paper presents a static analysis tool based on separation logic for
    verifying programs with unbounded linked data structures, directly addressing
    memory safety, spatial safety, and program analysis through formal semantics and
    pointer analysis techniques.
