  title: 'QLCoder: A Query Synthesizer For Static Analysis of Security Vulnerabilities'

  summary: Static analysis tools provide a powerful means to detect security vulnerabilities
    by specifying queries that encode vulnerable code patterns. However, writing such
    queries is challenging and requires diverse expertise in security and program
    analysis. To address this challenge, we present QLCoder - an agentic framework
    that automatically synthesizes queries in CodeQL, a powerful static analysis engine,
    directly from a given CVE metadata. QLCode embeds an LLM in a synthesis loop with
    execution feedback, while constraining its reasoning using a custom MCP interface
    that allows structured interaction with a Language Server Protocol (for syntax
    guidance) and a RAG database (for semantic retrieval of queries and documentation).
    This approach allows QLCoder to generate syntactically and semantically valid
    security queries. We evaluate QLCode on 176 existing CVEs across 111 Java projects.
    Building upon the Claude Code agent framework, QLCoder synthesizes correct queries
    that detect the CVE in the vulnerable but not in the patched versions for 53.4%
    of CVEs. In comparison, using only Claude Code synthesizes 10% correct queries.
  tldr: '- Addresses the difficulty of manually writing static analysis queries (e.g.,
    in CodeQL) to detect vulnerabilities from CVE descriptions, which requires specialized
    security and program analysis expertise.

    - Uses an LLM-driven agent with execution feedback, constrained by a structured
    interface to a Language Server Protocol for syntax and a RAG database for semantic
    guidance, to automatically generate CodeQL queries from CVE metadata.

    - Achieves 53.4% success in generating queries that correctly identify vulnerabilities
    in vulnerable code versions but not in patched ones, compared to 10% without the
    framework, enhancing scalable detection of memory safety and security flaws in
    software.'
  ai_score: 8
  ai_reason: The paper directly addresses program analysis and security vulnerability
    detection through static analysis, which strongly intersects with memory safety,
    pointer analysis, program analysis, and sanitizer techniques.
