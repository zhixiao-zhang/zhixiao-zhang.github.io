  title: Towards Cumulative Abstract Semantics via Handlers
  authors:

  summary: 'We consider the problem of modularizing control flow in a generic abstract
    interpretation framework. A generic abstract interpretation framework is not truly
    flexible if it does not allow interpreting with different path- and flow-sensitivities,
    by going forwards or backwards, and over- or under-approximately. Most interpreters
    inherently intertwine syntax and semantics, making the implementation antagonistic
    to modularity. Current approaches to modular designs require the use of complex
    data structures (e.g., monad transformers), providing modularity but often proving
    unwieldy (e.g., lifts). We observe that leveraging scoped effects within an interpreter
    facilitates the accumulation of semantic fragments against a fixed syntax. In
    this paper, we define cumulative abstract semantics, illustrating the potential
    for creating multiple dynamic evaluators and static analyses from one interpreter.
    This modularity is achieved by grouping effects into two categories: syntax elimination
    and domain-semantic introduction handlers. Our contribution shows the benefits
    of using effects as an instrument for designing a clean, elegant, and modular
    abstract interpretation framework.'
  tldr: '- Addresses the rigidity in abstract interpretation frameworks that intertwine
    syntax and semantics, hindering modular adjustments like path sensitivity or direction
    of analysis.

    - Uses scoped effects and effect handlers to separate syntax elimination from
    domain-specific semantics, allowing semantic fragments to accumulate against a
    fixed syntax.

    - Enables flexible, reusable interpreters for diverse static analyses, enhancing
    memory safety by supporting precise, customizable low-level program analyses without
    complex monad transformers.'
  ai_score: 8
  ai_reason: The paper's focus on modular abstract interpretation frameworks, effects,
    and static analysis directly aligns with the researcher's interests in program
    analysis, formal semantics, and abstract interpretation, though it does not explicitly
    address memory safety, Rust, or sanitizers.

  title: Lax Modal Lambda Calculi
  authors:
  - Nachiappan Valliappan
  summary: Intuitionistic modal logics (IMLs) extend intuitionistic propositional
    logic with modalities such as the box and diamond connectives. Advances in the
    study of IMLs have inspired several applications in programming languages via
    the development of corresponding type theories with modalities. Until recently,
    IMLs with diamonds have been misunderstood as somewhat peculiar and unstable,
    causing the development of type theories with diamonds to lag behind type theories
    with boxes. In this article, we develop a family of typed-lambda calculi corresponding
    to sublogics of a peculiar IML with diamonds known as Lax logic. These calculi
    provide a modal logical foundation for various strong functors in typed-functional
    programming. We present possible-world and categorical semantics for these calculi
    and constructively prove normalization, equational completeness and proof-theoretic
    inadmissibility results. Our main results have been formalized using the proof
    assistant Agda.
  tldr: '- Addresses the underdevelopment of programming language type theories that
    incorporate diamond modalities, which are essential for modeling certain computational
    effects and strong functors in functional programming.

    - Introduces a family of typed lambda calculi based on sublogics of Lax logic,
    providing formal semantics and proving properties like normalization and equational
    completeness, with Agda formalizations.

    - Enhances memory and system security by enabling more precise type systems that
    can statically enforce safety properties for effectful computations, reducing
    runtime errors and vulnerabilities.'
  ai_score: 7
  ai_reason: The paper develops modal lambda calculi rooted in type theory, which
    directly connects to the researcher's focus on type systems, formal semantics,
    and type theory, though it does not directly address memory safety, Rust, or program
    analysis.
