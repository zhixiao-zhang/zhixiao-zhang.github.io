  summary: Function contract generation is a classical problem in program analysis
    that targets the automated analysis of functions in a program with multiple procedures.
    The problem is fundamental in inter-procedural analysis where properties of functions
    are first obtained via the generation of function contracts and then the generated
    contracts are used as building blocks to analyze the whole program. Typical objectives
    in function contract generation include pre-/post-conditions and assigns information
    (that specifies the modification information over program variables and memory
    segments during function execution). In programs with array manipulations, a crucial
    point in function contract generation is the treatment of array segments that
    imposes challenges in inferring invariants and assigns information over such segments.
    To address this challenge, we propose a novel symbolic execution framework that
    carries invariants and assigns information over contiguous segments of arrays.
    We implement our framework as a prototype within LLVM, and further integrate our
    prototype with the ACSL assertion format and the Frama-C software verification
    platform. Experimental evaluation over a variety of benchmarks from the literature
    and functions from realistic libraries shows that our framework is capable of
    handling array manipulating functions that indeed involve the carry of array information
    and are beyond existing approaches.
  tldr: '- The paper addresses the challenge of automatically generating precise function
    contracts (pre-/post-conditions and modification summaries) for programs that
    manipulate arrays, where existing methods struggle to track invariants and modifications
    over specific array segments.


    - It introduces a symbolic execution technique that explicitly tracks and propagates
    invariants and modification summaries for contiguous segments of arrays as the
    analysis proceeds, enabling accurate reasoning about partial array updates.


    - This matters because it allows automated verification tools to soundly analyze
    low-level, array-intensive code (common in systems software) by generating correct
    contracts, which is essential for scaling formal methods to prove memory safety
    and functional correctness in inter-procedural analysis.'
  ai_score: 9
  ai_reason: The paper directly addresses function contract generation for programs
    with array manipulations, which is a core program analysis task intersecting memory
    safety (spatial safety via array segment analysis), type systems (via invariants),
    and formal semantics (via symbolic execution and contract specification), aligning
    closely with the researcher's focus areas.
