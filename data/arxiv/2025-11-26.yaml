  summary: 'Existing C to Rust translation techniques fail to balance quality and
    scalability: transpilation-based approaches scale to large projects but produce
    code with poor safety, idiomaticity, and readability. In contrast, LLM-based techniques
    are prohibitively expensive due to their reliance on frontier models (without
    which they cannot reliably generate compilable translations), thus limiting scalability.
    This paper proposes Rustine, a fully automated pipeline for effective and efficient
    repository-level C to idiomatic safe Rust translation. Evaluating on a diverse
    set of 23 C programs, ranging from 27 to 13,200 lines of code, Rustine can generate
    fully compilable Rust code for all and achieve 87% functional equivalence (passing
    1,063,099 assertions out of 1,221,192 in test suites with average function and
    line coverage of 74.7% and 72.2%). Compared to six prior repository-level C to
    Rust translation techniques, the translations by Rustine are overall safer (fewer
    raw pointers, pointer arithmetic, and unsafe constructs), more idiomatic (fewer
    Rust linter violations), and more readable. When the translations cannot pass
    all tests to fulfill functional equivalence, human developers were able to complete
    the task in 4.5 hours, on average, using Rustine as debugging support.'
  tldr: '- Addresses the gap in C-to-Rust translation where existing methods either
    produce unsafe, unidiomatic code at scale or are too computationally expensive
    to apply to large repositories.

    - Uses a fully automated pipeline (Rustine) that generates compilable, idiomatic
    Rust by balancing safety features and readability, avoiding excessive unsafe constructs
    and raw pointers.

    - Matters because it enables practical migration of legacy C systems to memory-safe
    Rust, reducing security risks from memory corruption vulnerabilities without requiring
    prohibitive resources.'
  ai_score: 8
  ai_reason: The paper directly addresses memory safety through automated C-to-Rust
    translation that produces safer code with fewer unsafe constructs and raw pointers,
    while also leveraging Rust's type system and program analysis techniques.
