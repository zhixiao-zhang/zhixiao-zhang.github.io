  title: Deadlock-free Context-free Session Types
  authors:
  - Andreia Mordido
  - Jorge A. Pérez
  summary: 'We tackle the problem of statically ensuring that message-passing programs
    never run into deadlocks. We focus on concurrent functional programs governed
    by context-free session types, which can express rich tree-like structures not
    expressible in standard session types. We propose a new type system based on context-free
    session types: it enforces both protocol conformance and deadlock freedom, also
    for programs implementing cyclic communication topologies with recursion and polymorphism.
    We show how the priority-based approach to deadlock freedom can be extended to
    this expressive setting. We prove that well-typed concurrent programs respect
    their protocols and never deadlock.'
  tldr: '- Addresses the risk of deadlocks in message-passing concurrent programs
    using expressive, tree-like communication protocols (context-free session types),
    which standard session types cannot handle.


    - Uses a priority-based type system that statically enforces both adherence to
    these complex protocols and deadlock freedom, even with recursion, polymorphism,
    and cyclic communication topologies.


    - Matters for system security and low-level safety by guaranteeing reliable, predictable
    concurrent execution without deadlocks, a critical failure mode in distributed
    systems and parallel software.'

  ai_reason: The paper's focus on static deadlock freedom via a type system for message-passing
    concurrency directly aligns with the researcher's interests in type systems, formal
    semantics, and program analysis, though its emphasis on session types and concurrency
    is more specific than the listed memory/temporal/spatial safety and Rust topics.
