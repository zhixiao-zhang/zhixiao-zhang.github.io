  title: Handling Scope Checks (Extended Version)

  summary: 'Metaprogramming and effect handlers interact in unexpected, and sometimes
    undesirable, ways. One example is scope extrusion: the generation of ill-scoped
    code. Scope extrusion can either be preemptively prevented, via static type systems,
    or retroactively detected, via dynamic checks. Static type systems exist in theory,
    but struggle with a range of implementation and usability problems in practice.
    In contrast, dynamic checks exist in practice (e.g. in MetaOCaml), but are understudied
    in theory. Designers of metalanguages are thus given little guidance regarding
    the design and implementation of checks. We present the first formal study of
    dynamic scope extrusion checks, introducing a calculus ($λ_{\langle\langle\text{op}\rangle\rangle}$)
    for describing and evaluating checks. Further, we introduce a novel dynamic check
    $\unicode{x2014}$ the "Cause-for-Concern" check $\unicode{x2014}$ which we prove
    correct, characterise without reference to its implementation, and argue combines
    the advantages of existing dynamic checks. Finally, we extend our framework with
    refined environment classifiers, which statically prevent scope extrusion, and
    compare their expressivity with the dynamic checks.'
  tldr: '- Addresses the risk of scope extrusion in metaprogramming, where effect
    handlers can generate ill-scoped code that may lead to unsafe program behavior,
    a gap between theoretical type systems and practical dynamic checks in metalanguages.


    - Introduces a formal calculus (λ₍₍ₒₚ₎₎) to model dynamic checks and proposes
    the "Cause-for-Concern" check, a dynamic mechanism that detects scope extrusion
    by tracking environment interactions without relying on static types.


    - Enhances memory and system security by preventing scope extrusion that could
    cause undefined behavior in low-level code generation, offering a practical, provably
    correct alternative to static type systems for safer metaprogramming in languages
    like MetaOCaml.'
  ai_score: 8
  ai_reason: The paper's formal study of dynamic scope extrusion checks in metaprogramming
    directly addresses program analysis, type systems, formal semantics, and sanitizer-like
    dynamic checks, which are core to the researcher's focus on safety and verification.

  title: Symmetric Proofs of Parameterized Programs
  authors:
  - Ruotong Cheng
  - Azadeh Farzan
  summary: We investigate the problem of safety verification of infinite-state parameterized
    programs that are formed based on a rich class of topologies. We introduce a new
    proof system, called parametric proof spaces, which exploits the underlying symmetry
    in such programs. This is a local notion of symmetry which enables the proof system
    to reuse proof arguments for isomorphic neighbourhoods in program topologies.
    We prove a sophisticated relative completeness result for the proof system with
    respect to a class of universally quantified invariants. We also investigate the
    problem of algorithmic construction of these proofs. We present a construction,
    inspired by classic results in model theory, where an infinitary limit program
    can be soundly and completely verified in place of the parameterized family, under
    some conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate how these proofs can be constructed
    and checked against these programs without the need for axiomatization of the
    underlying topology for proofs or the programs. Finally, we present conditions
    under which our algorithm becomes a decision procedure.
  tldr: '- Addresses the challenge of verifying safety for infinite-state parameterized
    programs with complex network topologies, where manual or exhaustive verification
    is infeasible due to scalability.

    - Introduces parametric proof spaces that leverage local symmetry in program topologies
    to reuse proofs for isomorphic neighborhoods, avoiding axiomatization of the topology.

    - Enables automated, scalable safety verification for low-level concurrent or
    distributed systems, directly enhancing memory and system security by provably
    preventing errors in parameterized architectures like grids or rings.'
  ai_score: 7
  ai_reason: The paper's focus on safety verification, infinite-state parameterized
    programs, and algorithmic proof construction for universally quantified invariants
    aligns directly with the researcher's interests in program analysis, formal semantics,
    and type systems for ensuring memory and spatial safety.
