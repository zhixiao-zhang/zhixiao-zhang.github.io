  title: 'Soteria: Efficient Symbolic Execution as a Functional Library'

  summary: Symbolic execution (SE) tools often rely on intermediate languages (ILs)
    to support multiple programming languages, promising reusability and efficiency.
    In practice, this approach introduces trade-offs between performance, accuracy,
    and language feature support. We argue that building SE engines \emph{directly}
    for each source language is both simpler and more effective. We present Soteria,
    a lightweight OCaml library for writing SE engines in a functional style, without
    compromising on performance, accuracy or feature support. Soteria enables developers
    to construct SE engines that operate directly over source-language semantics,
    offering \emph{configurability}, compositional reasoning, and ease of implementation.
    Using Soteria, we develop Soteria$^{\text{Rust}}$, the \emph{first} Rust SE engine
    supporting Tree Borrows (the intricate aliasing model of Rust), and Soteria$^{\text{C}}$,
    a compositional SE engine for C. Both tools are competitive with or outperform
    state-of-the-art tools such as Kani, Pulse, CBMC and Gillian-C in performance
    and the number of bugs detected. We formalise the theoretical foundations of Soteria
    and prove its soundness, demonstrating that sound, efficient, accurate, and expressive
    SE can be achieved without the compromises of ILs.
  tldr: '- Addresses performance and feature limitations in symbolic execution tools
    caused by intermediate languages, which hinder accurate analysis of complex language
    semantics like Rust''s aliasing rules.

    - Provides a functional OCaml library for building symbolic execution engines
    directly in source languages, enabling precise, configurable analysis without
    intermediate translation.

    - Enables the first sound Rust symbolic execution engine supporting Tree Borrows,
    crucial for verifying memory safety and preventing bugs in unsafe code blocks
    of systems software.'
  ai_score: 8
  ai_reason: The paper directly addresses Rust, formal semantics, program analysis,
    and symbolic execution while contributing to memory safety through bug detection
    and supporting Rust's aliasing model.
